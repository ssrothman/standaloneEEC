file structure is a bit funky to align with the way things look inside CMSSW.
just roll with it

file structure:
    SRothman/Matching: submodule with particle matching code
    SRothman/EECs: submodule with EEC computation code
    SRothman/arma...: copy of armadillo library source
    SRothman/SimonTools: submodule with some utility functions

Some example useage is in main.cc

Dependencies:
   armadillo: does some linear algebra stuff. 
              the files are included in the repo, 
              so you don't need to do anything.
              also, library is header-only, so no need to compile
   root: needed for the Minuit2 minimizer. 
              can install through conda or whatever
              will need to modify path in the makefile
    boost: needs to be reasonably modern
              can install through conda or whatever

The matching class has a huge amount of configuration options
    Details for these can be found in the python config for the CMSSW build
    at https://github.com/ssrothman/Cmssw-UserCode/blob/EECs_106x/Matching/python/GenMatchProducer_cfi.py

Presumably this documentation is still gonna be super insufficient, so lets talk about things and flesh it out as you have issues

A few comments on places that things will have to be changed:
    for the pp measurement we're using pT as the energy coordinate in the EECs, 
        but presumably for e+e- we'll want to use actual total energy
        so presumably we will have to go into the EEC code to change this
    also, for the pp measurement we're using (eta, phi) coordinates, and angular distances are all in Delta R (ie L2 norm in (eta, phi) space)
        probably for e+e- everything will be in terms of actual angle. 
        we will have to change how the angular windows in the matching work
        and also how the EEC bins are defined
