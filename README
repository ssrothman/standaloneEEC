file structure is a bit funky to align with the way things look inside CMSSW.
just roll with it

file structure:
    SRothman/Matching: submodule with particle matching code
    SRothman/EECs: submodule with EEC computation code
    SRothman/arma...: copy of armadillo library source
    SRothman/SimonTools: submodule with some utility functions

Dependencies:
   armadillo: does some linear algebra stuff. 
              the files are included in the repo, 
              so you don't need to do anything.
              also, library is header-only, so no need to compile
   root: needed for the Minuit2 minimizer. 
              can install through conda or whatever
              will need to modify path in the makefile
    boost: needs to be reasonably modern
              can install through conda or whatever
